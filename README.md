# machine-learning-python

## Description

A repository for studing "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists" by Andreas C. Muller and Sarah Guido.

The code in this repository may go beyond what’s covered in the book. Partly because I treat it as a sandbox for practicing and experimenting, and partly because the book was published back in 2017. It’s still excellent, but I’m working with more recent versions of the libraries than those used in the original examples.

## Environment

* Python 3.11.9
* Virtual environment: venv
* Dependencies: env/requirements.txt
